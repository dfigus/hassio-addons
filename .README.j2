## About

Home Assistant allows anyone to create add-on repositories to share their
add-ons for Home Assistant easily. This repository is one of those repositories,
providing extra Home Assistant add-ons for your installation.

The primary goal of this project is to provide you (as a Home Assistant user)
with additional, high quality, add-ons that allow you to take your automated
home to the next level, developed by [GauthamVarmaK][gautham].

This has been possible thanks to the community add-ons initiative by [Frenck]

## Installation

Adding this add-ons repository to your Home Assistant instance is pretty easy. In
 the Home Assistant add-on store, a possibility to add a repository is provided.

Use the following URL to add this repository:

```txt
